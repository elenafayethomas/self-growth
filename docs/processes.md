## Contribution Guidelines

Contribution guidelines are important for both open source projects and for projects that span a company. GitHub have [guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors) on how to write a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with some good examples from projects such as [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) or the [Open Government](https://github.com/opengovernment/opengovernment/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

From having written contribution guidelines, it is best to keep them brief whilst providing links to more information. This is to allow for quick onboarding for people unfamiliar to the project whilst allowing people to have more in depth information on design guidelines, testing, and so on, if required.
